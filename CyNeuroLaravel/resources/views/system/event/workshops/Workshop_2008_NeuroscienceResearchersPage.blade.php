                <p>
                    We are organizing a 4-day summer workshop in 2018 under the theme of: “Annual Neuroscience Cyberinfrastructure
                    Users/Contributors Workshop”. All expenses to attend the workshop will be covered through NSF-supported travel
                    grants. We welcome participants to apply (including undergraduate and graduate students, PostDocs, research faculty,
                    educators, system administrators, network engineers, and industry).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Cyberinfrastructure Users Workshop portion will be led by Prof. Satish Nair and will target participants
                    who are neuroscientists and engineers interested in effectively exploiting advanced cyberinfrastructure
                    capabilities for their research and education efforts. The Cyberinfrastructure Contributors Workshop will
                    be led by Prof. Prasad Calyam and will target participants who are computational and data scientists, and
                    engineers who are also researchers and developers of new cyberinfrastructure capabilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Training Agenda for Cyberinfrastructure Users Workshop portion includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tutorials on advanced software packages that are based on high-performance computation resources and computational modeling techniques in neuroscience</li>
                    <li>Tutorials on tools for data management (i.e., data import/export across distributed systems, data storage technologies and best practices, and data access control)</li>
                    <li>Independent study time periods and cohort discussion of relevant online study material for computational neuroscience students (e.g., tutorial videos, laboratory exercises)</li>
                    <li>Expert talks on use of advanced cyberinfrastructure resources for a broad range of theory and real world cases</li>
                    <li>Tour of MU data center and research laboratories of collaborators</li>
                    <li>Team-based mini-project assignments that allow students to apply and extend the skills gained via tutorials and expert talks.</li>
                </ul>
